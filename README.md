# Scheme Interpreter
This was coded during my CS61A class at Berkeley. This was my first time coding an interpreter for an entire programming language. 
It was the final project for the course. Scheme.py contains the main functionality of the interpreter. 

Below shows a basic demo of the interpreter when it is running in the terminal.

Afterwards, I used the interpreter I built to create a visualization of a recursive process that was written in Scheme. Running the program took about 1-2 hours since you would see the process being drawn in real-time. It is based on using turtle graphics with Scheme. 

Below is a picture of the final product:

I entered it into the class contest and it was a good learning experience.
