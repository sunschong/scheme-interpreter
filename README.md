# Scheme Interpreter
This was coded during my CS61A class at Berkeley. This was my first time coding an interpreter for an entire programming language. 
It was the final project for the course. Scheme.py contains the main functionality of the interpreter. 

Below shows a basic demo of the interpreter when it is running in the terminal.
